The cost includes the new panel, all materials, permits, labor, and inspection fees. More complex installations or those requiring significant wiring upgrades may cost more. We provide detailed estimates before starting work so you know exactly what to expect."

Simple surface-mount installations may take less time, while flush-mount installations or those requiring additional work may take a full day. The complete timeline from initial consultation to final inspection is usually one to two weeks, which includes time for permit approval and scheduling the city inspection."

Improper installations create fire hazards and code violations. Licensed electricians have the training, tools, and experience to upgrade panels safely. Insurance companies and building departments require licensed professionals for panel work."

The panel upgrade provides more capacity to distribute power safely, but it doesn't use more electricity. You'll only see higher bills if you add new appliances or devices that consume more power. Many homeowners actually save money because upgraded panels eliminate inefficiencies from overloaded circuits."

If you're adding an EV charger, hot tub, or major appliances, your existing panel may lack adequate capacity. We provide free assessments to determine if upgrades are needed."

Modern Las Vegas homes need 200-amp service to safely handle air conditioning, kitchen appliances, electronics, and electric vehicle chargers. Most homes built before 1990 have 100-amp panels that cannot meet today's electrical demands."

Total power-off time is usually 4 to 6 hours."

                Your electrical panel is the heart of your home's electrical
                system. It distributes power to every circuit and protects your
                home from electrical overloads. An outdated or undersized panel
                creates safety hazards and limits your ability to use modern
                appliances and devices. Electrician Las Vegas provides
                professional electrical panel upgrade services for homes
                throughout the Las Vegas Valley.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most Las Vegas homes built before 2000 need electrical panel
                upgrades to handle today's electrical demands. A typical home
                from the 1980s has a 100-amp electrical panel. Modern homes
                require 200-amp service to safely power air conditioning
                systems, kitchen appliances, computers, entertainment systems,
                and electric vehicle chargers. The gap between old capacity and
                current needs causes frequent problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our experienced electricians assess your current electrical
                system and recommend the right panel upgrade for your home. We
                handle every aspect of the upgrade process including permits,
                utility coordination, installation, and final inspection. The
                result is a modern electrical system that safely handles your
                current needs and provides capacity for future additions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Panel upgrades improve safety by eliminating overloaded circuits
                and outdated equipment. They also increase your home's value and
                make it easier to sell. Insurance companies view updated
                electrical systems favorably, and some offer reduced premiums
                for homes with modern electrical panels.

                Recognizing when your electrical panel can no longer safely
                handle your home's demands helps you address problems before
                they become dangerous. Several warning signs indicate that your
                Las Vegas home needs an electrical panel upgrade.
              </p>
              <h3>Frequent Circuit Breaker Trips</h3>
              <p>
                If circuit breakers trip regularly, especially when running air
                conditioning and other appliances simultaneously, your
                electrical panel lacks adequate capacity. Breakers trip to
                protect your home from dangerous overloads. Frequent tripping
                means your electrical demands exceed your panel's capacity. This
                isn't just inconvenient—it indicates a safety issue that
                requires attention.
              </p>
              <h3>Dimming or Flickering Lights</h3>
              <p>
                Lights that dim when you start appliances indicate voltage drops
                from inadequate electrical capacity. This happens when your
                electrical panel struggles to distribute power to all circuits
                simultaneously. Flickering lights show unstable power
                distribution that can damage sensitive electronics and
                appliances.
              </p>
              <h3>Warm or Hot Electrical Panel</h3>
              <p>
                An electrical panel should never feel warm or hot to the touch.
                Heat indicates dangerous overloading or failing components. A
                hot panel represents an active fire hazard that requires
                immediate professional attention. Never ignore a panel that
                feels warm—call for electrical service right away.
              </p>
              <h3>Inability to Add New Circuits</h3>
              <p>
                If you want to
                <a href="/ev-charger-installation"
                  >add an electric vehicle charger</a
                >, hot tub, or major appliance but your panel has no available
                breaker spaces, you need an upgrade. Even if spaces are
                available, your panel may lack the electrical capacity to
                support additional loads. We calculate your total electrical
                load to determine if your panel can safely handle additions.
              </p>
              <h3>Old or Obsolete Panel Types</h3>
              <p>
                Homes with Federal Pacific, Zinsco, or other obsolete panel
                brands should be upgraded immediately. These panels have known
                safety issues and may not protect your home properly. Insurance
                companies often require replacement of these dangerous panels.
                Our electricians identify problematic panel types and recommend
                appropriate replacements.

          <h2>Understanding Electrical Panel Capacity</h2>
          <hr />
          <div class="content-image-section">
            <div class="content-area highlight-box">
              <p>
                Electrical panels are rated by their amperage capacity, which
                determines how much electrical power they can safely distribute.
                Understanding panel capacity helps you recognize when upgrades
                are necessary for your Las Vegas home.
              </p>
              <h3>100-Amp Electrical Panels</h3>
              <p>
                Most Las Vegas homes built before 1990 have 100-amp electrical
                panels. These panels provided adequate capacity when homes had
                fewer appliances and smaller air conditioning systems. Today, a
                100-amp panel struggles to handle modern electrical demands,
                especially during Las Vegas summers when air conditioners run
                constantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                A 100-amp panel can safely provide about 19,200 watts of power.
                This might sound like a lot, but a central air conditioner uses
                3,000 to 5,000 watts, an electric water heater uses 4,000 watts,
                an electric range uses 3,000 watts, and an electric dryer uses
                3,000 watts. Add computers, televisions, and other devices, and
                you quickly approach or exceed the panel's capacity.
              </p>
              <h3>200-Amp Electrical Panels</h3>
              <p>
                Modern homes require 200-amp electrical service. This capacity
                safely handles air conditioning, kitchen appliances, laundry
                equipment, electronics, and allows room for future additions
                like electric vehicle chargers. A 200-amp panel provides about
                38,400 watts of available power—double the capacity of a 100-amp
                panel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upgrading from 100-amp to 200-amp service eliminates frequent
                breaker trips and voltage problems. You can run your air
                conditioning, use kitchen appliances, and charge your electric
                vehicle simultaneously without electrical issues. The additional
                capacity also supports home additions and upgrades without
                further electrical work.
              </p>
              <h3>Calculating Your Electrical Load</h3>
              <p>
                Our electricians calculate your home's total electrical load to
                determine the right panel size. This calculation includes all
                major appliances, heating and cooling systems, lighting, and
                planned additions. We ensure your new panel has adequate
                capacity plus reserve for future needs. Proper load calculation
                prevents installing a panel that's still too small for your
                requirements.

                Understanding what happens during an electrical panel upgrade
                helps you prepare for the project and know what to expect. Our
                systematic approach ensures safe, code-compliant installations
                that pass inspection the first time.
              </p>
              <h3>Initial Inspection and Assessment</h3>
              <p>
                The upgrade process begins with our experienced electrician
                inspecting your current electrical system. We examine your
                existing panel, evaluate its condition, check for code
                violations, and identify any problems with your electrical
                wiring. We measure your current electrical load and discuss your
                future electrical needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the inspection, we provide a detailed proposal explaining
                what work is needed and why. You receive clear pricing that
                includes all permits, materials, labor, and inspection fees. We
                answer your questions and ensure you understand the entire
                process before work begins.
              </p>
              <h3>Permits and Utility Coordination</h3>
              <p>
                Electrical panel upgrades require permits from your local
                building department. We handle all permit applications and
                paperwork. Panel upgrades also require coordination with your
                utility company to disconnect and reconnect power. We schedule
                utility service and ensure minimal disruption to your daily
                routine.
              </p>
              <p>
                The permit process typically takes one to three days depending
                on your local jurisdiction. We don't start work until all
                permits are approved. This ensures your upgrade meets all code
                requirements and passes final inspection.
              </p>
              <h3>Installation Day Process</h3>
              <p>
                Panel upgrade installation typically takes six to eight hours.
                Our electricians arrive at the scheduled time with all necessary
                materials and equipment. We start by documenting your existing
                panel configuration and labeling all circuits so we know where
                everything connects.
              </p>
              <h3>Power Shutdown and Old Panel Removal</h3>
              <p>
                The utility company temporarily disconnects power to your home
                at the meter. This allows us to work safely on your electrical
                service entrance. We then carefully remove your old panel,
                documenting and photographing all connections. This
                documentation ensures proper reconnection in the new panel.
              </p>
              <h3>New Panel Installation</h3>
              <p>
                We install the new 200-amp panel in the same location or
                relocate it if needed for code compliance or convenience. The
                installation includes mounting the new panel securely,
                connecting the service entrance cables, installing the main
                breaker, and installing individual circuit breakers for all your
                home's circuits.
              </p>
              <p>
                We reconnect each circuit to the appropriate breaker, ensuring
                proper wire sizing and protection. All connections are made
                according to current electrical codes. We also upgrade the
                grounding system if needed to meet current requirements. Proper
                grounding is essential for electrical safety and protects
                against shocks and surges.
              </p>
              <h3>System Testing and Verification</h3>
              <p>
                After installation, we test every circuit to verify proper
                operation. We check voltage at outlets throughout your home,
                verify that all switches and outlets work correctly, and
                <a href="/gfci-outlet-installation">test GFCI outlets</a>. Load
                testing ensures the panel can handle your electrical demands
                without problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                We show you the new panel and explain how it works. You'll learn
                which breakers control which circuits, how to reset a tripped
                breaker, and when to call for service. Clear labeling makes it
                easy to identify circuits when needed.

            <div class="content-area highlight-box">
              <p>
                City electrical inspections verify that panel upgrades meet all
                safety codes and are installed correctly. We coordinate all
                inspections and ensure your upgrade passes on the first attempt.
              </p>
              <h3>What Inspectors Check</h3>
              <p>
                Electrical inspectors examine the panel installation, verify
                proper wire sizing, check all connections, confirm adequate
                grounding, and ensure code compliance. They also verify that the
                installation matches the approved permit. Our experience with
                local inspectors and code requirements ensures your upgrade
                meets all standards.
              </p>
              <h3>After Inspection Completion</h3>
              <p>
                Once the inspection passes, you receive official documentation
                showing your electrical system is code-compliant. This
                documentation is important for insurance purposes and future
                home sales. We provide copies of all permits, inspection
                certificates, and warranty information.
              </p>
              <p>
                If exterior work was needed to install the new panel, we repair
                any damage to stucco, siding, or drywall. We clean the work area
                thoroughly and remove all debris. Your home is left clean with a
                fully functional, upgraded electrical system.

              <p>
                Electrical panel upgrades provide numerous benefits beyond
                simply having more electrical capacity. Understanding these
                advantages helps you appreciate the value of this important home
                improvement.
              </p>
              <h3>Improved Safety</h3>
              <p>
                Modern electrical panels include better circuit protection and
                safety features. We install proper
                <a href="/circuit-breaker-repair">circuit breakers</a> in all
                upgraded panels. They respond faster to overloads and ground
                faults, protecting your home from electrical fires. Updated
                panels eliminate the fire hazards associated with old,
                overloaded electrical systems. This protection gives you peace
                of mind knowing your family and property are safe.
              </p>
              <h3>Increased Home Value</h3>
              <p>
                Homes with updated electrical systems are more attractive to
                buyers and typically sell for higher prices. Buyers appreciate
                knowing they won't need to invest in electrical upgrades
                immediately after purchase. Updated electrical systems also pass
                home inspections more easily, preventing issues during the sale
                process.
              </p>
              <h3>Lower Insurance Costs</h3>
              <p>
                Some insurance companies reduce premiums for homes with updated
                electrical systems. Old electrical panels increase the risk of
                electrical fires, leading to higher insurance rates. An updated
                panel demonstrates that your home meets current safety standards
                and presents lower risk.
              </p>
              <h3>Support for Modern Technology</h3>
              <p>
                Today's homes depend on technology that requires reliable
                electrical power. Computers, home offices, entertainment
                systems, and smart home devices all need stable electricity. An
                adequate electrical panel ensures these systems operate reliably
                without power issues that damage equipment or cause data loss.
              </p>
              <h3>Electric Vehicle Charging</h3>
              <p>
                Electric vehicle ownership is growing rapidly, and home charging
                provides the most convenient option.
                <a href="/ev-charger-installation">Installing an EV charger</a>
                requires a dedicated 240-volt circuit that draws significant
                power. Many 100-amp panels cannot support EV chargers along with
                existing electrical loads. Upgrading to 200-amp service makes
                home EV charging possible.

          <h2>Cost and Timeline for Panel Upgrades</h2>

          <div class="content-image-section">
            <div class="content-area highlight-box">
              <p>
                Understanding the investment required for panel upgrades helps
                you plan this important home improvement. Several factors affect
                the total cost and timeline for completing your electrical panel
                upgrade.
              </p>
              <h3>Typical Upgrade Costs</h3>
              <p>
                Electrical panel upgrades in Las Vegas typically cost between
                $1,500 and $3,000 depending on panel size, location, and
                complexity. This includes the panel, all materials, permits,
                labor, and inspection fees. More complex installations or those
                requiring significant wiring upgrades may cost more.
              </p>
              <p>
                The investment in a panel upgrade provides decades of safe
                electrical service and prevents the much higher costs of
                electrical fires or equipment damage from inadequate electrical
                systems. Consider the upgrade an investment in your home's
                safety, value, and functionality.
              </p>
              <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
              <p>
                Most panel upgrades are completed in one day. Simple
                installations may take six hours while more complex projects
                require a full day. Your power is only off intermittently during
                the upgrade, typically just a few hours while we make critical
                connections.
              </p>
              <p>
                The complete timeline from initial consultation to final
                inspection is typically one to two weeks. This includes time for
                the inspection, permit approval, scheduling installation,
                completing the work, and the final inspection. We work
                efficiently to minimize the time your home has an outdated
                electrical system.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                Most electrical panel upgrades are completed in one day,
                typically taking 6 to 8 hours. Simple surface-mount
                installations may take less time, while flush-mount
                installations or those requiring additional work may take a full

              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Yes, electrical panel upgrades require permits from your local
                building department in Las Vegas. We handle all permit
                applications and paperwork for you. Permits ensure the work
                meets safety codes and passes inspection. Never hire contractors
                who suggest skipping permits—this creates serious legal and
                safety issues that can affect insurance coverage and home sales.

                Can I upgrade my own electrical panel?
              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We strongly recommend against DIY electrical panel upgrades.
                Panel work involves high-voltage connections that can cause
                fatal electrocution. Improper installations create fire hazards
                and code violations. experienced electricians have the training,
                tools, and experience to upgrade panels safely. Insurance
                companies and building departments require experienced
                professionals for panel work.

              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                No, upgrading your electrical panel does not increase your
                electric bill. The panel upgrade provides more capacity to
                distribute power safely, but it doesn't use more electricity.
                You'll only see higher bills if you add new appliances or
                devices that consume more power. Many homeowners actually save
                money because upgraded panels eliminate inefficiencies from
                overloaded circuits.

              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Signs you need a panel upgrade include breakers that trip
                frequently, lights that dim when appliances start, a panel that
                feels warm to touch, inability to add circuits for new
                appliances, or having a 100-amp panel in a modern home. If
                you're adding an EV charger, hot tub, or major appliances, your
                existing panel may lack adequate capacity. We provide free
                assessments to determine if upgrades are needed.

              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                A 100-amp panel provides about 19,200 watts of power, while a
                200-amp panel provides about 38,400 watts—double the capacity.
                Modern Las Vegas homes need 200-amp service to safely handle air
                conditioning, kitchen appliances, electronics, and electric
                vehicle chargers. Most homes built before 1990 have 100-amp
                panels that cannot meet today's electrical demands.

              </h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Your power will be off intermittently during the upgrade,
                typically for only a few hours during critical connection work.
                We coordinate with the utility company to temporarily disconnect
                power at the meter. Most of the installation work happens with
                power off, but we restore power as quickly as possible. Total
                power-off time is usually 4 to 6 hours.
