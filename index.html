You may notice dimming lights when large appliances start up, smell burning plastic near the panel, or see discoloration on the panel cover. If you are constantly resetting breakers, your panel cannot handle your current electrical load. We perform a load calculation to determine whether you need a panel upgrade or if redistributing circuits will solve the problem."

It can also indicate a loose or failing neutral connection at the meter base or panel, which is dangerous. High temperatures cause metal expansion and increase resistance at weak connections. We test voltage drop under load and inspect service entry and panel connections."

                in Las Vegas before 2005 have 100-amp or 150-amp service. That

                generators, and upgraded to dual-zone HVAC systems. Now those

                protection where older homes never had it. We upgrade your
                service entry to 200 amps so you can run your pool pump, two air

                Desert heat makes wire insulation brittle over time. UV exposure
                degrades outdoor conduit. Thermal expansion causes connections
                to loosen inside junction boxes. We inspect these failure points
                before they become fire hazards.

              <p>
                If your breakers trip every time the AC kicks on, you've got
                undersized wire gauge or poor load calculations. We fix it the
                same day.

                properties in Las Vegas run hot. Rooftop HVAC units pull massive
                starting currents. Walk-in coolers cycle constantly. Exterior
                signage bakes in direct sun for 12 hours a day.

                We design and install three-phase power distribution for
                restaurants, retail spaces, and office buildings. We handle
                tenant improvement work for property managers who need NEMA 3R
                outdoor enclosures installed to Clark County code. We
                troubleshoot voltage drops in long conduit runs across parking

              <p>
                Power failures in Vegas aren't just inconvenient. When it's 105
                degrees outside and your AC stops running because a breaker
                failed, you've got hours before your house becomes unlivable.
              </p>
              <p>
                We respond to emergency calls for panel failures, tripped main
                breakers, burned-out meter bases, and electrical shorts. We
                carry replacement breakers, wire, and connectors in the truck.

                We've been working on Las Vegas electrical systems since 1980.
                We've seen this valley grow from 460,000 residents to over 2.2
                million. We've rewired homes as the grid expanded and power
                demands tripled.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're not here to upsell you on smart home gadgets or LED
                retrofits. We're here to make sure your electrical system
                doesn't start a fire or fail during a heatwave.
              </p>
              <p>
                Electrical fires in Las Vegas often start because homeowners
                don't realize their panel is operating at 95% capacity. When
                your AC compressor starts up, it draws a surge current that can
                overload an already-stressed breaker. Add in a pool pump and an
                electric water heater, and you're pushing system limits every
                single day from June through September.
              </p>
              <p>
                We perform load calculations based on your actual usage. We open
                your panel and check for loose connections, corroded bus bars,
                and signs of overheating. We test your ground fault protection
                and make sure your service entry conduit isn't cracked from
                thermal cycling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clark County requires specific installations for outdoor
                circuits, pool equipment, and detached structures. We know those
                codes. Your electrical work will pass inspection the first time.

              <h3>Local Knowledge of Nevada's Unique Power Demands</h3>
              <p>
                Air conditioning is the single biggest electrical load in every
                Las Vegas home. A 5-ton AC unit pulls 30 to 40 amps at startup.
                If you've got two units, you're looking at 60 to 80 amps of
                starting current hitting your panel simultaneously.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most homes have 200-amp service. That sounds like plenty until
                you account for the AC units, electric water heater, dryer,
                range, pool equipment, and EV charger all running at once. The
                math stops working.
              </p>
              <p>
                We install subpanels for pool equipment and outdoor circuits to
                distribute the load. We upgrade wire gauge on long runs to
                minimize voltage drop. We replace single-pole breakers with
                tandem breakers where code allows.
              </p>
              <p>
                NV Energy has specific requirements for meter bases and service
                entry installations. We coordinate with them directly so you
                don't have to deal with utility bureaucracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Summer heat causes thermal expansion inside your electrical
                panel. Breaker connections that were tight in February can
                loosen by July. Loose connections create resistance. Resistance
                creates heat. Heat leads to failure.
              </p>

              <p>
                You call us because something's wrong. We show up, diagnose the
                issue, and tell you exactly what it costs to fix it. No games.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most service calls are completed the same day. If your repair
                requires parts we don't stock in the truck, we source them
                locally and return to finish the job. We don't leave your home
                without power unless there's a safety reason.

              <h3>How do I know if my panel is overloaded?</h3>
              <p>
                Your panel is overloaded if breakers trip frequently, especially
                when the AC turns on. You'll notice dimming lights when large
                appliances start up. You might smell burning plastic near the
                panel or see discoloration on the panel cover. If you're
                constantly resetting breakers, your panel can't handle your
                current electrical load. We perform a load calculation to
                determine if you need a panel upgrade or if redistributing
                circuits solves the problem.

              <h3>Are my outdoor outlets safe for the monsoon season?</h3>
              <p>
                Outdoor outlets in Las Vegas take a beating from UV exposure,
                dust storms, and monsoon rains. If your outlets don't have
                weatherproof covers and
                <a href="gfci-outlet-installation">GFCI protection</a>, they're
                not safe. Water intrusion into a non-GFCI outlet creates a shock
                hazard. We install NEMA 3R rated enclosures on all outdoor
                outlets and verify GFCI protection is functioning. If water
                pools near your outdoor outlets or you see corrosion on the
                outlet face, shut off the circuit and call us.

              <h3>What causes flickering lights during a Vegas heatwave?</h3>
              <p>
                Flickering lights during high temperatures usually mean your AC
                compressor is pulling too much current from the same circuit leg
                as your lighting. When the compressor starts, it causes a
                voltage drop that dims the lights momentarily. This can also
                indicate a loose neutral connection at your meter base or main
                panel, which is dangerous. High heat causes metal to expand, and
                poor connections create resistance. We test for voltage drop
                under load and check all connections at your service entry and
                panel.
